A simple "roll a ball" game made with Unity. The player controls a ball inside a platform and has to collect coins to get points as the time goes down. The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible without the timer going to zero or falling out of the platforms. The game offers some special objects to help or challenge the player.

Tested on Windows, Ubuntu and Android.

## Features

- The game includes four platforms and the player can jump to one another with the help of special ramps that will appear after an amount of points has been collected. With each subsequent platform, the player will be able to get more points but also be in more danger.
- At random times, wind will appear and hinder the player's movement. The player has to obtain the atom object to stop the wind.
- Additionally, the ground size decreases as time passes. The player needs to obtain the plus object or he risks falling off the platform!
- Walls around the platform help the player so he does not fall down. However, with every wall hit, the wall will move down and after a few hits the wall will not be able to protect the player from falling down.
